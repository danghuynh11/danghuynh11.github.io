### CPSC 120

* Lab 3

    Lab 3, part 1 was a favorite because it was the first lab where we actually started coding so it holds a lot of memories to me. I learned that in order to store words, string variables must be declared. Another thing I learned is that you can refer to your variables in the output.

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 1 was a favorite because I learned about Julian Day. Since you needed to find the difference between two dates, you had to initialize two different variables and subtract them. Another thing I learned is that in order to use the user input, you must call the variable from within the function.

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 2 was a favorite because one person in my group would constantly change the secret number and the other two would have to guess what the number was. I discovered that by creating a boolean variable and setting it to false, you can control an almost infinite loop. I also learned that in order to escape a loop, you must either press the control and 'c' keys simultaneously or use a break in your loop.
